            I am a Front End Web Developer holding a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of Central Florida, where I developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, responsive web design, and more.js An innovative problem-solver passionate about developing apps, my current focus is on mobile-first design and development. Since completing the bootcamp, I have continued my studies independently to learn more about iOS and Android development. Just a graphic designer looking to upgrade. You'll have to forgive the lack of content, soon I'll have more to say and show. For now I'm trying to wrap my head around CSS
